# Project title regulatory compliance


## Summary 
To build a MongoDB database for tracking regulatory compliance for government agencies and regulated entities, you should focus on five main collections: 1. Regulations Collection: Manages details about regulations, including a unique identifier, title, description, effective date, and categories to classify the regulation. 2. Entities Collection: Contains information about the entities subject to regulations, such as a unique identifier, name, type (e.g., government agency, private company), industry, and contact information. 3. ComplianceRecords Collections: Tracks compliance efforts and statuses for each entity against specific regulations, including a unique record ID, references to the entity and regulation, compliance status, and the date of assessment. 4. ComplianceTasks Collection: Lists specific tasks that need to be completed for compliance, including a task ID, reference to the related regulation, task description, deadline, and the entity responsible for completion. This structure allows for detailed management and tracking of regulatory compliance activities, facilitating efficient monitoring of compliance status, task management, and maintaining an audit trail for transparency and accountability.

### Specificatios
To build a MongoDB database for tracking regulatory compliance for government agencies and regulated entities, you should focus on five main collections: 
1. **Regulations Collection**: Manages details about regulations, including a unique identifier, title, description, effective date, and categories to classify the regulation. 
2. **Entities Collection**: Contains information about the entities subject to regulations, such as a unique identifier, name, type (e.g., government agency, private company), industry, and contact information. 
3. **ComplianceRecords Collection**: Tracks compliance efforts and statuses for each entity against specific regulations, including a unique record ID, references to the entity and regulation, compliance status, and the date of assessment.
 4. **ComplianceTasks Collection**: Lists specific tasks that need to be completed for compliance, including a task ID, reference to the related regulation, task description, deadline, and the entity responsible for completion. 
5. **AuditTrails Collection**: Records actions taken within the database for auditing purposes, such as an audit ID, involved entity, action type, affected collection, and timestamp of the action. This structure allows for detailed management and tracking of regulatory compliance activities, facilitating efficient monitoring of compliance status, task management, and maintaining an audit trail for transparency and accountability.

#### Conclusion
In summary, building a MongoDB database for regulatory compliance involves setting up structured collections to efficiently manage, monitor, and audit regulatory compliance across entities and regulations. This approach enhances compliance efforts, promotes accountability, and ensures transparency, ultimately helping entities to navigate and adhere to regulatory requirements more effectively.
